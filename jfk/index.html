		<p>"Jack," as Kennedy was called, and Jackie married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island. It was national news. LIFE magazine sent photographer Lisa Larsen, then in her late 20s, to cover the highly publicized event. The Catholic mass was attended by 750 guests and there were 900 guests at the reception- it took Senator and Mrs. Kennedy two hours to shake their hands.</p>
		<br/>
		
		<p>Jackie wore an ivory silk gown made by Ann Lowe, an African-American designer. Her rosepoint lace veil, worn first by her grandmother Lee, was draped from a tiara of lace and orange blossoms. She also wore a choker of pearls and a diamond bracelet that was a gift from the groom. The bride's bouquet was of pink and white spray orchids and gardenias. Jackie's younger sister, also named Lee, was matron of honour and the eleven bridesmaids were in pink taffeta. The groom on the other had arrived with a scratched face after being knocked into a rosebush in a last-minute game of touch football with his brothers and the ushers.</p>
		<br/>

		<p> The wedding is remembered as a lavish affair, and one enthusiastic guest said that had been "just like a coronation." Looking back on this elegant wedding, it's easy to see why Jackie and JFK are thought to be America's first sweet hearts.</p>
