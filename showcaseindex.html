		<p>On the 12 April 2014, we tied the knot in Stellenbosch surrounded by friends and family. It has now been over a year since that day and when we recently celebrated our first anniversary in Italy, we thought back on all the happiness and joy and we truly felt blessed to have such a wonderful memory to look back on and we decided that we just had to share it with the people who helped create it. </p>
		<br/>
		
		<p>These photos are a few from our collection that we love because they encapsulated our happiness so well. There were of course many other moments, that although weren't captured- we can look back on with immense gratitude and joy: from the ladies that helped with all the wedding plans (they were so good with putting up with our immanent stress and excitement), to the smiling faces in the pews to all individual gifts that people gave us and last but definitely not least to the people that travelled from far distances to make it to our special day. </p>
		<br/>

		<p>Perhaps the biggest thing we've done since the wedding is our recent trip to Italy for our anniversary. It was extremely special and when we were in Venice we took full advantage of drinking Italian wine and admiring the amazing amount of art the city had to offer. We even have a few prints that we had to bring back and frame in our house. Its amazing how much of a life one can grow together in only one year and we're only excited for the future adventures that are to come.</p>
		<br/>
		
		<p>Thank you for being part of this journey with us. Your wedding gifts have made our house into a home and your support for our happiness has only exceeded our expectations. </p>


		<p>All the best and lots of love,</p> 
		<p> Attie and Marlis</p>
